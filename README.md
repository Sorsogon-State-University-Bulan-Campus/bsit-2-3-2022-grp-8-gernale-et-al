## "PAINTINGS"

## FAQ
### WHAT?

Painting the expression of ideas and emotions, with the creation of certain aesthetic qualities, in a two-dimensional visual language. The elements of this language—its shapes, lines, colours, tones, and textures—are used in various ways to produce sensations of volume, space, movement, and light on a flat surface. These elements are combined into expressive patterns in order to represent real or supernatural phenomena, to interpret a narrative theme, or to create wholly abstract visual relationships. An artist’s decision to use a particular medium, such as tempera, fresco, oil, acrylic, watercolour or other water-based paints, ink, gouache, encaustic, or casein, as well as the choice of a particular form, such as mural, easel, panel, miniature, manuscript illumination, scroll, screen or fan, panorama, or any of a variety of modern forms, is based on the sensuous qualities and the expressive possibilities and limitations of those options. 

### WHO?

The first painting was made by primitive men, believed to have been made by Homo Neanderthalis in the prehistoric era. Archaeological excavations carried out in Europe, Africa and Asia reveal that primitive men were the first painters and sculptors and demonstrated through these arts their daily lives.

### WHERE?

It is believed that the first painting, which is also known as Rock Painting or Rock Art, was made in shelter, caves, which were used by nomadic people to protect themselves. These first paintings discovered by archaeologists, are vibrant paintings using more than three colors. These are paintings that have tried to imitate nature with maximum realism, based on observations made during the hunt. In a cave in Altamira in Spain, there is a rock painting of the Bison (ancestor of the Cow) and is impressive for its size, volume and for using the chiaroscuro technique.
